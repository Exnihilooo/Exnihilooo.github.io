    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Welcome come back</strong>! Maybe I shouldn’t say that, <del>because it’s my first time writing a post.</del></p>
<p>Back to business, I’m delighted and welcome to you <strong>Omnia</strong>, this is a website that is about <strong>computers</strong>, if you are a computer scientist, congratulations, you can always find something new on this website! if you are not, don’t worry, this website could be your entrance to the computing world! I’ll write posts about the <strong>most popular content in this recent time,</strong> sometimes interesting things I have written by myself. If you have any suggestions, you can always contact me by <strong>email</strong>, or if you want to build more connections with me, connecting me on <strong>LinkedIn</strong> will probably be a nice idea.</p>

<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Deep-Live-Cam is an open-source project, aiming to contribute AI-generated media industry. It can help artists with tasks such as animating a custom character or using a character as a clothing model. This project also supports real-time face-swapping and one-click video deepfake technology based on a single image.</p>
<p><del>It’s very similar to the project which was very popular last year called “Deep Face Lab”</del></p>
<p>Also, the developer realized this project could be used for unethical applications, so there is a built-in inspection mechanism, to prevent the usage of sensitive content such as nudity, violent content, war footage, etc.</p>
<h2 id="Core-Functionality"><a href="#Core-Functionality" class="headerlink" title="Core Functionality"></a>Core Functionality</h2><p>Image Face Swap: Replaces faces from one image to another.</p>
<p>Video Face Swap: Replace faces in real-time throughout a video.</p>
<p>Live Webcam Face Swap: Real-time face replacement during a live broadcast or video call.</p>

<h2 id="Introduction-1"><a href="#Introduction-1" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Teable is an innovative no-code platform that incorporates a Postgres database and an Airtable-style interface. It is designed to address the limitations of existing no-code tools such as performance bottlenecks, data ownership, scalability, and developer-friendliness. Teable’s goal is to create a comprehensive platform that is suitable for both non-technical users and professional developers.</p>

<h2 id="Introduction-2"><a href="#Introduction-2" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>This is a visualized crawler software, use graphic interface (GUI) to allows anyone who know or doesn’t know any programming basics. The only thing the user have to do is select the content that they want and follow the instruction,  design conveniently and execute task automatically.</p>

<h2 id="The-most-powerful-and-modular-stable-diffusion-GUI-and-backend"><a href="#The-most-powerful-and-modular-stable-diffusion-GUI-and-backend" class="headerlink" title="The most powerful and modular stable diffusion GUI and backend."></a>The most powerful and modular stable diffusion GUI and backend.</h2><h2 id="Introduction-3"><a href="#Introduction-3" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>I believe for the majority of people who have used generative AI painting before, the first thing they probably have used is Automatic1111 Web UI. Face too many options on the interface, many people don’t know where to go, as the develop of the generative AI painting, we have a lot of new models, algorithms, hardware etc, but there is no big change in operating logic, we need a revolution on that, his name is ComfyUI.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="/img/GWR-1.4.png"
                      alt="test"
                ></p>
<p>Comfy UI is not easier than Web UI, if I say Web UI is a dot on a paper, then Comfy UI is more like so many dots on a paper and you can connect them with many different lines. In Comfy UI, you can build up your own generative method with so many different components, which means you can build up barely infinite numbers of generative methods. In Comfy UI, you can call an output as an input in time, the same as calling a function or variable in any programming language, Comfy UI brings the workflow of generative AI painting.</p>
<h2 id="Features-1"><a href="#Features-1" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h2><ul>
<li>Nodes&#x2F;graph&#x2F;flowchart interface to experiment and create complex Stable Diffusion workflows without needing to code anything.</li>
<li>Excellent performance management</li>
<li>Support many different models</li>
<li>Support merger models </li>
<li>Support CPU mode</li>
<li>Support Lora</li>
<li>etc..</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I think Comfy UI could be a perfect replacement for the Web UI on top, but at the same time, there are more things you have to learn from Comfy UI compared to Web UI, after all, comfy UI is acting more professional.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for reading this post, and if you have any comments, you can contact me via email or LinkedIn! </p>
